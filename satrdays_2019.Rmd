# What does a data scientist do?

---
# Annswering questions based on data

--

Different scenarios:

--
- A client comes to you with a bunch of data and asks you to get some insights from it


--
- A client comes to you and ask you to retrieve some metrics, then you ask him for some data you'll need


--
- You find some good data / tools that could be of a good use for your work / client


--
- You're curious about something and want to explore more

---
# Sometimes in 2018...

# Not so fast!

+ For years 2011 to 2015, filenames are in the form `ircom_XXXX_revenusXXXX`, then `ircom_XXXX_revenus_XXXX`


--
+ For years 2011 to 2016, files are in an `xls` format and failed to be imported with `readxl::read_excel`, then `xlsx`


--
+ For years 2011 to 2014, NAs are indicated with `n.c.`, then `n.d.`


--
+ For years 2011 to 2015, only department data are present, then national and regional data are added


--
+ For years 2011 to 2015, taxes are given in euros, then in thousands of euros

# Homogeneity of postal codes

# Data quality

--
+ Homogeneity of geographical information accross years


--
+ Totals correspond to sum of individual categories


--
+ Totals of municipality correspond to total of departments


--
+ Count missing values

--
Some usefull packages for data quality : `janitor`, `naniar`

# Gini coefficient

Measures of inequality:

$$G = 1 - \sum\limits_{k = 0}^{n - 1}(X_{k+1} - X_{k})(Y_{k+1} + Y_{k})$$

+ `X`: Cumulated share of the population
+ `Y`: Cumulated share of the revenue

```{r, eval=FALSE}
gini <- function(pop, rev) {
  1 - sum(map_dbl(seq_along(pop)[-1], function(i) {(pop[i] - pop[i - 1]) * (rev[i] + rev[i - 1])}))
}

# Conclusion

--
+ What does a data scientist do? He answers a question and often ask more...


--
+ Importing data is not always straightforward


--
+ Data quality control is a necessity and usually takes most of the time


--
+ A data scientist needs to communicate with non technical people, shiny application are great tools to do that


--
+ Making packages helps a lot
